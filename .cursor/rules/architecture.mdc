# What is SAOC?

This is the website for St. Athanasius Orthodox Church, a parish community in Goleta, CA.
It is written in Bun with Hono, using server rendered HTML styled with Tailwind CSS.
The goal is to use simple technology. For example, we're deploying on EC2 with Systemd,
and will use SQLite and the local file system to store assets. This is just 
a church website, we don't need to be "web scale".

We use dbmate to manage database migrations. It's installed via bun, so run it as `bun dbmate ...`.
